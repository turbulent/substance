Installation
============

Substance supports all three main desktop operating systems: macOS, Windows,
and Linux. Its main prerequisite is `Oracle VirtualBox`_, which also supports
these platforms.

If an existing substance project is going to be used, make sure to check how much
RAM and disk space will be required before procceding with the installation.

On macOS
--------

Substance is not compatible with the Python distribution that ships with macOS.
You must use `Homebrew`_ to install the latest Python 2.x release.

#. Download and install `Oracle VirtualBox`_. Make sure ``VBoxManage`` is in
   your ``PATH`` environment variable.
#. Make sure Xcode CLI is installed::

    $ xcode-select --install

#. Ensure `Homebrew`_ is installed::

    $ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

#. Install Homebrew's Python (Version 3 and up) distribution::

    $ brew install python

#. Make sure that you are running python 3.x when installing substance. If there is 2 versions of python installed `python`/`pip` will probably be 2.7, and `python3`/`pip3` 3.x

#. The ``python3`` installed by homebrew should be located under ``/usr/local/bin``. The ``python`` version under ``/usr/bin`` is the one installed by default in MacOS. You can verify python version with ``--version`` argument and locate executable with ``which`` command.

   If homebrew's version is not found that's probably because it is not in your PATH.
   Use the command ``brew doctor``, copy the command to add it to your PATH and restart your terminal.

#. Ensure pip3 is up to date::

    $ sudo pip3 install -U pip

#. Install ``substance``::

    $ sudo pip3 install substance

On Windows (WSL)
----------

Disclaimer: Substance has only been tested on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit edition.

#. Install `Oracle VirtualBox`_. Make sure VBoxManage is in your ``PATH``
   environment variable (System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment
   Variables -> Path -> add path to your VirtualBox installation directory).

#. Open PowerShell (or cmd) as Administrator and run::

    Copy
    Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

#. Restart the computer

#. Download and install your distribution of choice. We recommend Debian/stretch from the Microsoft Store.

   1. Open the Microsoft Store and choose your favorite Linux distribution.
   2. Debian GNU/Linux (Stretch)

#. Install python3 on your linux distribution::

    $ apt-get update
    $ apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-pip

#. Install substance with `pip`::

    $ pip3 install substance


.. NOTES ABOUT WSL AND PATHS::

The home directory used by substance in WSL will be your Windows user's home directory (for example: C:\\Users\\USERNAME)
This is to allow your projects and code can be edited and modified from both programs inside WSL and outside.

For simplicity, the sync process (unison) within WSL will run the linux version.

On Windows (Cygwin)
----------

Due to poor support for command-line utilities on Windows, Cygwin is required
to run Substance on Windows.

Disclaimer: Substance has only been tested on Windows 10 Pro 64-bit edition.
Installation on 32-bit Windows is NOT supported.

#. Install `Oracle VirtualBox`_. Make sure VBoxManage is in your ``PATH``
   environment variable (System -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment
   Variables -> Path -> add path to your VirtualBox installation directory).
#. Install Cygwin 64-bit. Here are the steps:

   #. Create a directory ``C:\cygwin64`` on your main drive. Create a subdirectory
      named "setup" inside that directory.
   #. Download ``setup-x86-64.exe`` from ``https://www.cygwin.com/`` and place
      it in ``C:\cygwin64\setup``
   #. Double-click on ``setup-x86-64.exe``, and perform the install. Keep the
      default location and make sure the following packages are selected:

      * ``mintty`` (under "Shells")
      * ``make`` (under "Devel")
      * ``git`` (under "Devel")
      * ``gcc-core`` (under "Devel")
      * ``python2`` (under "Python")
      * ``python2-devel`` (under "Python")
      * ``libffi-devel`` (under "Libs")
      * ``openssl-devel`` (under "Net")

   #. Optionally, you can create a shortcut to ``setup-x86-64.exe`` and add it
      to your Start menu; you can re-run the setup whenever you want to add or
      remove packages to your Cygwin install.

#. Launch Cygwin Terminal (``mintty``). All the magic happens from there!
#. Run ``which python && which pip`` to make SURE that you are running both
   executables from ``/usr/bin``, NOT something like ``C:\Python``!
#. Execute the command ``python --version``. You should see an output like
   ``Python 2.7.12``.
#. Make sure ``pip`` is installed and is upgraded to the latest version by running
   the commands::

     $ python -m ensurepip
     $ pip install -U pip

#. Install ``substance``::

     $ pip install substance

On Linux
--------

Make sure you are running a 64-bit Linux distribution. 32-bit is NOT supported.
Substance has been tested on Mint, Ubuntu, and Arch Linux.

#. Install `Oracle VirtualBox`_. Make sure ``VBoxManage`` is in your ``PATH``
   environment variable.
#. Install the following software using your package manager. Of course,
   depending on the distribution, the package names may slightly vary (but you
   will usually find a proper equivalent):

   * ``git``
   * ``build-essential``
   * ``libffi-devel``
   * ``openssl-devel``

#. Make sure to have Python 2 available. On some distributions (like Ubuntu
   14.04), this is the default Python interpreter, which means you can use
   ``python`` and ``pip``. On other, more state-of-the-art distributions (like
   Arch), you need to install a separate ``python2`` package and use the
   commands ``python2`` and ``pip2`` for the rest of this guide. Also install
   ``python-devel`` or ``python2-devel``, depending on your distribution.

#. Install ``substance``::

     $ sudo pip install substance

Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This version of Ubuntu already comes with the development libraries required for
substance.

#. Install `Oracle VirtualBox`_.

#. Substance requires Python 3 and pip 3. Python 3 will be already installed and
   it is accessible with ``python3``. Install pip 3 with::

     $ sudo apt install pip3

#. Install ``substance``::

     $ sudo pip3 install substance

Make sure you use Python 3 and pip 3, and not the Python 2 counterpart.

Upgrading Substance to a new version
------------------------------------

On all supported platforms, these commands will allow you to update the
Substance on your machine without losing data or engines::

  $ sudo pip uninstall substance
  $ sudo pip install substance
